                        been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
                        I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                        thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                        completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a
                        VR startup. ”</p>

                            code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by
                            step.
                            I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                            about
                            the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and
                            I
                            never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                            outstanding.
                            It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
                            I’ve
                            often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
                            certainly
                            helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                            recommend!
